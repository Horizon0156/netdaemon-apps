# NetDaemon Apps
This is the dev. setup and repository for my NetDaemon applications connected to Home Assistant. 

There are some basic setups for controlling lights on time-, sun- or motion- based events as well as some more complex extensions that enables support for Homematic Keypress events in order to root the wall switches to certain lights. Alarm system will follow soon.

Please head over to Tomas template repository for further information about NetDaemon and how to start local development https://github.com/net-daemon/netdaemon-app-template.

For a multi-arch Docker image that ships NetDaemon standalone next to your Home Assistant instance, please visit https://github.com/Horizon0156/netdaemon
